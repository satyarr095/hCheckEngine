# HYPHENATION RULES FOR LLM PROCESSING

## 1. DICTIONARY SELECTION RULES
- IF language_variant == "US English":
  - PRIMARY_DICTIONARY = "Merriam Webster"
- IF language_variant == "UK English":
  - PRIMARY_DICTIONARY = "Oxford" OR "Collins"

## 2. TEXT ANALYSIS SCOPE
### INCLUDE these sections:
- Body text
- Figure captions
- Table captions and content
- Abstracts
- Title
- Keywords
- Headings

### EXCLUDE these sections:
- Reference section
- In-text citations
- Author names and affiliations
- Corresponding author email addresses

## 3. CONTEXT ANALYSIS RULES
### Rule 3.1: Compound Adjective Detection
- IF word_pattern matches "[adjective]-[adjective] [noun]":
  - APPLY: Hyphenate compound adjective before noun
  - EXAMPLE: "well known fact" → "well-known fact"
  - REASON: Compound adjective modifying a noun

### Rule 3.2: Predicate Adjective Detection
- IF word_pattern matches "[noun] [verb] [adjective] [adjective]":
  - APPLY: Remove hyphen in predicate position
  - EXAMPLE: "fact is well-known" → "fact is well known"
  - REASON: Adjective follows the noun (predicate position)

## 4. LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC HYPHENATION RULES
### Rule 4.1: US English Hyphenation
- IF language_variant == "US English":
  - "co-operation" → "cooperation" (Remove hyphen, close up)
  - REASON: Per Merriam Webster, cooperation should be without hyphen as noun

### Rule 4.2: UK English Hyphenation
- IF language_variant == "UK English":
  - "cooperation" → "co-operation" (Add hyphen)
  - REASON: Per Oxford/Collins dictionary, co-operation should be hyphenated as noun

## 5. DICTIONARY CONSISTENCY RULES
### Rule 5.1: Dictionary Lookup Process
1. CHECK if term exists in primary dictionary
2. IF term NOT found in dictionary:
   - SCAN document for variant forms (hyphenated, closed, spaced)
   - COUNT occurrences of each variant
   - IF multiple variants found: FLAG as inconsistent
   - IF single variant used: ACCEPT as author-defined

### Rule 5.2: Consistency Flagging
- EXAMPLE: Document contains:
  - "sub-circle" (2 instances)
  - "subcircle" (3 instances)  
  - "sub circle" (2 instances)
- ACTION: FLAG inconsistency, suggest unifying to most frequent form

## 6. GRAMMATICAL HYPHENATION RULES
### Rule 6.1: Compound Modifiers Before Nouns
- PATTERN: "[adjective]-[adjective] [noun]"
- EXAMPLES: "state-of-the-art method", "high-risk group"
- ACTION: Ensure hyphenation when compound modifier precedes noun

### Rule 6.2: Avoid False Positives After Nouns
- PATTERN: "[noun] [verb] [adjective] [adjective]"
- EXAMPLE: "The method is state of the art" (CORRECT - no hyphen needed)
- ACTION: Do not suggest hyphenation in predicate position

### Rule 6.3: Adverb-Adjective Combinations
- IF first_word.endswith("-ly") AND second_word.is_adjective():
  - ACTION: Remove hyphen
  - EXAMPLE: "highly-efficient method" → "highly efficient method"
  - REASON: Adverbs ending in -ly should not be hyphenated to adjectives

### Rule 6.4: Hyphen vs En Dash Detection
- PATTERN: "[geographic_location]-[geographic_location]"
- ACTION: Suggest en dash instead of hyphen
- EXAMPLE: "Asia-Europe route" → "Asia–Europe route"

### Rule 6.5: Ambiguous Terms
- MAINTAIN distinction between:
  - "re-form" (to form again) vs "reform" (to change)
  - "re-sign" (to sign again) vs "resign" (to quit job)
- ACTION: Analyze context to determine correct form

### Rule 6.6: Number + Unit/Descriptor Compounds
#### As Adjectives (hyphenate):
- PATTERN: "[number]-[unit/descriptor] [noun]"
- EXAMPLES: "5-year plan", "10-fold increase"

#### As Nouns (do not hyphenate):
- PATTERN: "[noun] [verb] [number] [unit]"
- EXAMPLE: "The plan lasts 5 years"

## 7. OUTPUT FILTERING RULES
### Rule 7.1: Only Flag Errors
- DO NOT flag correctly hyphenated terms
- ONLY flag: Incorrect hyphenation, Missing hyphens, Inconsistent usage
- PROVIDE: Original text, Suggested correction, Reason for change

## 8. PROCESSING PRIORITY
1. Check dictionary existence (Rules 1, 5)
2. Analyze grammatical context (Rules 3, 6)
3. Apply language-specific rules (Rule 4)
4. Verify consistency (Rule 5)
5. Format output (Rule 7)
